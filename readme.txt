Hello there and welcome to our project repo about task scheduling in distributed systems.

Just thought id let you know that the code here is for reading purposes only...

Though! if you do want to run it I can show you how :)

*Actually Running It*
Hopefully you have the newest JDK installed on your computer, if not i'd do that now.
After that go a head and open the command line and run these commands

`git clone https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid.git`
`cd simgrid`

These will install the newest versions of SimGrid on to your computer.
these will have all the example files and platforms in all the languages SimGrid Supports 

Now we used Visual Studio Code to run this project 
- this would also include the microsoft supported Java extensions to make things easy to run.
  + debugger for java
  + extension pack for java
  + language support for java by red hat
  + maven for java
  + project manager for java
  + test runner for java
- you may not need all of these but for completions sake the list is there for you. 

So, after installing SimGrid you're also going to need its newest Jar file
this can be found here: https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid/actions/workflows/jarfile.yml

go ahead and install the newest version.

Now you want to open the entire examples folder in Visual Studio Code, this will set you up with a java project all ready to go.
(if this doesnt work go ahead and create your own)

Finally, in Visual Studio Code go to Java Projects in the Explorer Tab, and add the SimGrid.jar to the Referenced Libraries. 

After that its all set and ready to run!
